Psuedo-random data project

Re-energized and inspired from our road trip to Boston, and attending the Boston Data fest #ODSCEast at the Microsoft NERD center, here are our learnings from the talks and workshops there. Great resources and ideas for projects in doing data science for social good, healthcare, finance and numerous other areas.
